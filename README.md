# wine_quality

This project is about analyzing and modeling the quality of wine using various data analysis and machine learning techniques. The dataset used in this project is the Wine Quality dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset contains information about various physicochemical properties of red and white wine, along with their quality ratings.

The project involves the following steps:

Data Preprocessing:

Handling Missing Values: The missing values were identified and imputed with appropriate values.

Handling Duplicates: The duplicate rows were identified and removed from the dataset.

Handling Outliers: Outliers were detected and treated using the IQR method.

Feature Scaling: Standard scaling was performed on the continuous variables.

Exploratory Data Analysis:

Univariate Analysis: Histograms and box plots were plotted to understand the distribution and spread of the variables.

Bivariate Analysis: Scatter plots and correlation matrices were plotted to identify the correlation between variables.

Modeling:

Linear Regression: Linear regression was performed to understand the relationship between the independent variables and quality.

Logistic Regression: Logistic regression was performed to predict the quality of the wine as good or bad.

Model Evaluation: The models were evaluated using r-squared metrics and confusion matrix.

Conclusion and Recommendations:

Based on the analysis and modeling, certain recommendations were made to improve the quality of wine.

The project was implemented using Python programming language and various libraries such as pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, and scikit-learn.

The code files and datasets used in this project are available in this repository.
